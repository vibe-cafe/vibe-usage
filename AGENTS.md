## Key Conventions

- **Pure ESM** (`"type": "module"`) — no CommonJS, no build step
- **Zero dependencies** — only Node built-ins (fs, path, os, crypto, https, readline, child_process, zlib, `node:sqlite`)
- **Incremental sync** — parsers stay stateless (compute full totals from raw logs each run, server upserts idempotently), but `sync.js` diffs each item's content-hash against `~/.vibe-usage/state.json` and uploads only new/changed buckets/sessions — a quiet machine sends zero bytes. State is committed per-batch only after that batch's upload succeeds (failed batch re-sends next run); prune of dead keys (logs the parsers no longer emit) persists unconditionally and is bounded by liveness, never by age. Deleting `state.json` triggers a one-time full re-upload.
- **Stable hostname** — hostname is persisted in config at init; `sync.js` never re-reads `os.hostname()` after first capture. This prevents macOS mDNS hostname drift (e.g., `-2`, `-3` suffixes) from creating duplicate device entries in the DB.
- **No TypeScript** — plain JavaScript throughout
- **Output style** — user-facing text is Chinese (colored via `output.js` helpers: `success` / `failure` / `warn` / `arrow` / `link`). Dashboard URLs use OSC 8 hyperlinks so terminals that support it (iTerm2, Warp, VSCode, Kitty, Terminal.app 14+) render them as clickable. Raw pass-through from external tools (parser errors, `systemctl` / `launchctl` output, daemon loop timestamps) is kept in English and dimmed so it's visually de-emphasized. `init` prints a big ASCII logo; other commands print a compact one-line header (`bigHeader()` / `smallHeader()` from `output.js`).

## Architecture: Two-Track Data Model

Every parser produces two parallel data streams:

### Track 1: Token Buckets
Per-message token usage aggregated into 30-minute windows via `aggregateToBuckets()`.

```js
{ source, model, project, bucketStart, inputTokens, outputTokens, cachedInputTokens, reasoningOutputTokens, totalTokens }
```

### Track 2: Sessions
Timing events fed to `extractSessions()` for interaction metadata.

```js
// Input event shape:
{ sessionId, source, project, timestamp: Date, role: 'user' | 'assistant' }

// Output session shape:
{ source, project, sessionHash, firstMessageAt, lastMessageAt, durationSeconds, activeSeconds, messageCount, userMessageCount, userPromptHours }
```

`activeSeconds` = sum of turn durations (user prompt to last assistant message before next user prompt).

## Adding a New Parser

1. Create `src/parsers/<tool-id>.js` exporting `async function parse()` returning `{ buckets: [], sessions: [] }`
2. Register in `src/parsers/index.js` — import + add to `parsers` object
3. Add tool entry in `src/tools.js` — `{ name, id, dataDir }` (alphabetical by id)
4. Update `README.md` supported tools table
5. **Backend**: append the source to `USAGE_SOURCES` in `vibe-cafe/apps/web/src/lib/usage-sources.ts` (ingest filter and `/usage` chip list both derive from it). Release ordering between vibe-usage publish and vibe-cafe deploy is no longer load-bearing — the ingest endpoint **soft-drops** unknown sources (returns them in `dropped: { buckets, unknownSources }` instead of 400ing the batch) so other parsers' data still lands. Until the source is registered server-side, `sync.js` prints a dim "X buckets dropped (服务端未收录的 source: …)" line.

Parser pattern:
- Read local log files from the tool's data directory
- Extract per-message token entries → `aggregateToBuckets(entries)`
- Extract user/assistant timing events → `extractSessions(events)`
- Handle missing/corrupt files gracefully (try/catch, skip bad lines)

SQLite-backed parsers (cursor, opencode, kiro, hermes):
- Use `queryDbJson(dbPath, sql)` from `src/parsers/sqlite.js` — never shell out to `sqlite3` directly. It prefers Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`, opened read-only; Node ≥ 22.5, works on Windows with no extra binary) and falls back to the `sqlite3` CLI on older Node.
- Rows come back as plain objects (`{ column: value }`), same shape as `sqlite3 -json` — INTEGER → number, TEXT → string, JSON via `json_extract` → string.
- If neither `node:sqlite` nor the CLI is available the helper throws an `ENOENT`-flavored error; catch it and rethrow `'sqlite3 CLI not found. Install sqlite3 (or use Node >= 22.5) to sync X data.'` so the user gets a hint.
- For DBs the source app holds a write lock on (Cursor, Kiro): catch `/database is locked/i`, copy the DB (+ `-wal`/`-shm`) to a temp dir, and re-query the snapshot.

Network-fetch parsers (the Cursor exception):
- Cursor stores no usage locally — only an auth token in `state.vscdb`. The parser reads the token via `queryDbJson()`, then GETs a CSV from `cursor.com`.
- Always wrap network calls with `AbortSignal.timeout(...)` so a single hung host can't stall the whole sync (sync.js catches throws per-parser but cannot interrupt a hanging await).
- Mark transient/network errors with `err.skip = true` so the parser silently returns empty (avoids noisy daemon logs every 5 min). Only auth/permanent errors should bubble up.

Codex forked sessions (`codex.js`):
- Forking a Codex conversation writes a *new* rollout file that replays the entire source conversation at the top — every `event_msg/token_count` included, all timestamped in a 1–3s burst at the fork instant. Those tokens are already counted from the source session's own file, so naively parsing the fork double-counts and spikes token/cost at the fork timestamp.
- Timestamps **cannot** discriminate the replay (Codex stamps it at/after the fork's `session_meta` time, not before). The parser instead does two passes: pass 1 indexes every file by `session_meta.payload.id` and counts its `token_count` records; pass 2 skips exactly that many leading `token_count`s in any file whose `session_meta.payload.forked_from_id` points at it. A fork copies the source file verbatim, so the skip count == source's total count — this is also correct for chained forks (fork-of-a-fork replays the parent's whole file). If the source file is missing, skip nothing (over-count on incomplete data beats silently dropping real usage).
- Both passes **stream** each rollout file line-by-line (`node:readline` over a `createReadStream`), never `readFileSync` into memory. Large `~/.codex/sessions` histories (hundreds of files, some >100 MB) otherwise OOM the V8 heap during `JSON.parse`. The trade-off is reading each file twice (pass 1 indexes id/fork/project/token_count count via `indexSessionFile`; pass 2 re-streams for usage extraction) — bounded memory beats a single-pass read that retains gigabytes of transcript text.

Codex archived sessions (`codex.js`, `tools.js`):
- Codex moves a "completed" session's rollout file from `~/.codex/sessions/` to `~/.codex/archived_sessions/`. The parser scans **both** dirs in one pass (`SESSIONS_DIRS`); scanning only the live dir permanently lost any session archived between two syncs. Re-reading an already-synced archived file is idempotent (stateless parser, server dedups), and indexing both dirs together keeps fork replay-skip correct when a fork and its parent are split across them.
- Session timing events are grouped by the real `session_meta.payload.id`, not the file path — the same session can momentarily exist in both dirs, and path-keying would emit two `sessionHash`es and double-count its stats. `findCodexDataDirs` in `tools.js` likewise treats either dir as "Codex installed".

## Development & Testing

# Quick parser test
node -e "import('./src/parsers/<tool-id>.js').then(m => m.parse()).then(r => console.log(JSON.stringify(r, null, 2)))"
```
